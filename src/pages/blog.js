                            <p>Take a cryptocurrency, what's the current problem in it? High volatility. Remove the volatility and make it more stable than its collateral; that's a reflex index. Currently researching the RAI reflex index, designed to be a non-anchored stablecoin, but what I'm most interested in is its ability to retain it's purchasing power (unlike traditional fiat currencies and anchored stablecoins), which is what fascinates me.</p>

                            <p>We should consider using the term "Decentralised Finance" more often when referring to blockchain-based infrastructural cryptocurrency projects, rather than just "crypto", which might seem a bit "cryptic" to the general audience.</p>
