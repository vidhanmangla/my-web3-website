                            <p>This is a new type of crypto wallet that gives you "the same features a bank would, without having to trust a bank."</p>
                        <br></br>

                            <p><u>USING CUSTOM ERRORS INSTEAD OF REVERT STRINGS (SAVE HUGE DEPLOYMENT GAS COSTS)</u></p>
                        <br></br>
                        <br></br>
                            <p>Solidity developers often neglect custom errors, despite their usefulness. Solidity 0.8.4 introduced them as a cost-effective way to display errors, replacing the expensive revert strings used before.</p>
                        <br></br>
                        <br></br>
                            <p>You can define errors with the error keyword, the type of errors you can define are:</p>
                        <br></br>
                            <li>Errors</li>
                        <br></br>
                            <li>Errors with parameters</li>
                        <br></br>
                            <li>Errors in depth</li>
                        <br></br>
                        <br></br>
                            <p>You can place the error condition in an if condition and reverting the transaction, errors can be declared inside or outside the smart contract scope.</p>
                        <br></br>
                        <br></br>
                            <p>The following code shows how to use custom errors in solidity and what's the gas difference in both of them.</p>
                        <br></br>
                        <br></br>

                            <p>Deployment Gas Costs:</p>
                        <br></br>
                            <p>Contract - RequireErrors: 230288 gas</p>
                            <p>Contract - CustomError: 201559 gas</p>
                        <br></br>
                            <p>Error Gas Cost When Condition is Met:</p>
                        <br></br>
                            <p>function requireError(): 23642</p>
                            <p>function customError(): 23388</p>
                        <br></br>
                        <br></br>
                            <p>Custom Errors will save huge deployment gas costs for you and you'll be able to write much more lines of code.</p>

                            <p><u>WHAT EXACTLY HAPPENS WHEN YOU DESTRUCT A SOLIDITY SMART CONTRACT?üî•</u></p>
                        <br></br>
                        <br></br>
                            <p>The contract stops execution in its current scope (number++ is not executed after the selfdestruct was initiated), and flags the contract for deletion. It doesn‚Äôt get deleted right away, so you can still call its functions (in this case the autogenerated number() function).</p>
                        <br></br>
                        <br></br>
                            <p>The native selfdestruct() function takes one argument of type ‚Äúaddress payable‚Äù to which it‚Äôs going to send all native tokens (ETH on Ethereum, BNB on Binance Smart Chain, MATIC on Polygon, ‚Ä¶) that the contract holds.</p>
                        <br></br>
                        <br></br>
                            <p>Since this is not a regular transfer, it does not invoke the receive() nor fallback() functions on the recipient contract. So you effectively can force send ETH to a contract this way.</p>
                        <br></br>
                        <br></br>
                            <p>Non-native tokens (ERC-20, NFTs, etc.) are stored in their respective contracts, making it impossible for a contract to know which tokens it owns. If a contract is destroyed, all non-native tokens held by the contract address become inaccessible due to the absence of a private key. This is crucial to consider before implementing the destruct feature in your contracts.</p>
                        <br></br>
                        <br></br>
                            <img src={Self_destruct} alt="Gas" width={500} height={500} />
                        <br></br>
                        <br></br>
                            <p>Solidity version 0.8.18 has deprecated the selfdestruct() function, which is intended to be replaced by SENDALL opcode. The new function, likely to be called sendall(), will send all native tokens to a designated address, but will not remove the contract bytecode.
