                            <p>We create inflation by printing money like newspaper, we take money out of pocket of the poor and the middle-class, and all we’ve got left to do is give out a public statement,</p>
                        <br></br>
                            <p>“Bank of England in a desperate attempt to save the economy raises interest rates to fight inflation.”</p>
                        <br></br>
                        <br></br>
                            <p>Inflation the enemy, who created it? Us! Give out a public statement,</p>
                        <br></br>
                            <p>“Bitcoin is the enemy!”.</p>

                            <p><u>Silicon Valley Bank and USDC</u> (March 13, 2023)</p>
                        <br></br>
                        <br></br>
                            <p>USDC is a form of cryptocurrency that is tethered to the value of the US dollar. This means that one USDC is always equivalent to one US dollar. The token is an ERC-20 variety that is constructed on the Ethereum blockchain, and it is issued by CENTRE, a cooperative effort between Circle and Coinbase.</p>
                        <br></br>
                            <p>When an individual desires to purchase USDC, they must first deposit US dollars into a CENTRE bank account. They will then receive the equivalent amount of USDC tokens in exchange, or they can acquire them from an exchange. The US dollars that are deposited into the CENTRE bank account are kept in reserve and are subjected to frequent third-party audits to guarantee that there are always enough funds available to back the USDC tokens that are in circulation. USDC tokens can be exchanged for US dollars at any moment by sending them back to the CENTRE, which will then transfer the equivalent sum of US dollars to the user's bank account.</p>
                        <br></br>
                            <p>Turning our attention now to Silvergate, it is widely recognized as being one of the most cryptocurrency-friendly banks, as well as the largest bank for technology startups. It has recently announced its intention to terminate its operations and liquidate its bank. CENTRE has approximately $3.3 billion invested with Silicon Valley Bank, but it is unclear how much it will receive in return. As a result, the value of USDC has been de-pegged from the US dollar.</p>
